## Hi there 👋

I'm a computational physics student[^1] who spends most of his time solving ODEs and PDEs in Julia.

## Recent project: 2D wave simulation

Using the hyperbolic approximation of the Serre-Green-Naghdi equations to simulate realistic wave propagation over complex bathymetry.

## 🚀 Open Source Contributions

I contribute to the **Julia scientific computing ecosystem**:

- **[OrdinaryDiffEq.jl](https://github.com/SciML/OrdinaryDiffEq.jl)** - High-performance ODE solvers
- **[DispersiveShallowWater.jl](https://github.com/NumericalMathematics/DispersiveShallowWater.jl)** - Dispersive wave equations solvers


## 🤖 Academic AI Transparency

I maintain a detailed **[AI Code of Conduct](https://cwittens.github.io/academic-ai-code-of-conduct/)** documenting how I use AI tools (Claude, GitHub Copilot) in my academic work, emphasizing verification, understanding, and maintaining intellectual integrity.
